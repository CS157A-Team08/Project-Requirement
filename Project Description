Project Description

The primary objective of our Dining System is to accomplish self-ordering and checkout
for customers in a restaurant. Therefore, there could be no waiters being involved during a meal
in any restaurant by using our dining system. Once customers are in the restaurant, they can use a
phone or any other device to log in to our Dining System. After that, a menu of all the food that
is currently available to order will be displayed on the page, and customers can add or remove
the dishes to the cart as needed. Once customers finish dining, they can also self-checking out on
the Dining System before leaving. Another main deliverable of our project is the management
function of the system. Owner/ manager can view the statistic of sales in the management side of
the system. This will give them more information for ordering stock and making business
decisions.
The use of self-serving devices will increase profits in the long-term since fewer workers
will be needed to take orders and prepare checks for customers. There will still be a need for
human workers, but rather than spending time taking customer orders, they can focus on
improving customer experience, which will in turn, bring customers back into the restaurant
more often. Customer satisfaction will be improved since workers can focus on keeping the
restaurant clean, checking up on how customers are doing, and ensuring the quality of the food is
up to standards. Not only will profits increase for investors, but the reputation of the company
will be improved once people associate the company with quality experiences.
All member in the group is going to be the main internal stakeholder of the system. As member are
involved in development process, all group member will affect the outcome of the project. Class
instructor and teaching assistant are also stakeholders of the project. Their advice and feedback 
affect members development decision and thus they affect the outcome of the project.
