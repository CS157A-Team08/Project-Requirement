Project Description
The primary objective of our Dining System is to accomplish self-ordering and checkout for customers in a restaurant. Therefore, there could be no waiters being involved during a meal in any restaurant by using our dining system. Once customers are in the restaurant, they can use a phone or any other device to log in to our Dining System. After that, a menu of all the food that is currently available to order will be displayed on the page, and customers can add or remove the dishes to the cart as needed. Once customers finish dining, they can also self-checking out on the Dining System before leaving. Another main deliverable of our project is the management function of the system. Owner/ manager can view the statistic of sales in the management side of the system. This will give them more information for ordering stock and making business decisions.
The use of self-serving devices will increase profits in the long-term since fewer workers will be needed to take orders and prepare checks for customers.  There will still be a need for human workers, but rather than spending time taking customer orders, they can focus on improving customer experience, which will in turn, bring customers back into the restaurant more often.  Customer satisfaction will be improved since workers can focus on keeping the restaurant clean, checking up on how customers are doing, and ensuring the quality of the food is up to standards.  Not only will profits increase for investors, but the reputation of the company will be improved once people associate the company with quality experiences. 
All member in the group is going to be the main internal stakeholder of the system. As member are involved in development process, all group member will affect the outcome of the project. Class instructor and teaching assistant are also stakeholders of the project. Their advice and feedback affect members development decision and thus they affect the outcome of the project.
Non-functional requirement
Graphical user interface (GUI)
The user interface self-serve dining system is web-base in order to obtain higher compatibility for different hardware device. The main requirement to the graphic user interface is to be easy to use, clear and no confusion. Since this is multiple category of users, Each type of user should have to its own sub-page to divide function they can access to avoid confusion. To access to sub interface besides the one for customers, there will be restriction such as passcode to allow access. Toolbar are place on top to allow user switch their roles.  For different sub-page, there are different domain of graphical needs. Customer sub-page is more image and graphic focus to appeal customers and let customer have a better idea of the food. Two column layout is applied to the design: one for showing menu item and one for showing selected item. Toolbar are place bottom perform payment for next step. For management and customer service staff interface, two column structure are also used to divide menu of operation and content of each operation. These two sub page will be more text focus to optimal functionality. For kitchen staff sub page, there are also two column on the GUI. One of it will be individual orders grouped by customers to show order of each customers. The other column will show the order by food item and quantity. This can give the kitchen staff a statistic of how many food they have to prepare.
Security
To protect the non-customer functional in the system, each staff, manager and owner will have their own account associate with unique ID and password. For example, functional like deleting or alter an existing order requirement password input to proceed. Also, management functional are also password protected to avoid customer access. Finished order, altered and deleted order and stored in database to add security to the system in case of misuse or fraud to the business. In addition, devices used in this dining system should have its own private network to prevent intruder access.
